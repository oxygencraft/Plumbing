# Game Info

You start with some water and you need to keep it moving and avoid it touching obstacles. If it does touch obstacles, you will lose water. When you lose all your water or no water particles are within the view of the camera, you lose.

The water is constantly moving forward. You cannot physically move the water. Instead, you must influence the water's movement. You have influencing ability which is like currency for influencing water. If you have no influencing ability, you cannot influence the water. Influencing ability decreases slowly over time. Influencing ability decreases quickly while you are influencing water. The speed it decreases at depends on the influence you are currently using. You can gain influencing ability by colliding into obstacles but you will still lose water. The obstacle will slowly wear off and break when exposed to water.

The water will perform random actions at random times. The water sometimes might ignore your influence.
